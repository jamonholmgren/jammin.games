          Hi! I'm Jamon Holmgren, a software developer, entrepreneur, and indie
          game developer based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
        </p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I started programming at age 12 on a 286, writing games in QBasic.
            That early exposure to coding sparked a lifelong passion for
            software development. Today, I'm the co-founder and CTO of
            <a href="https://infinite.red" target="_blank">Infinite Red</a>, a
            React Native consulting company, and in my spare time, I build games
            using the
            <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot</a> game
            engine.
          </p>

          <h2>Game Development Journey</h2>
          <p>
            While I've been a professional web and mobile developer for over two
            decades, game development was where I started and where my interests
            have remained. I built games the whole time using QBasic, Gamemaker,
            and the web, but never launched any of them. But in 2024, inspired
            by my
            <a href="https://twitch.tv/deadslap" target="_blank"
              >brother Denton</a
            >, I decided to dive deep into Godot development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is where I'll be sharing my game development projects
            going forward!

          <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding or building games, you might find me playing rec
            league ice hockey as a goalie, puttering around my 3 acre property
            on my Kubota tractor, spending time with my family, or working on
            various open source projects. I occasionally stream on Twitch and
            create YouTube content. You'll find me most active on
            <a href="https://x.com/jamonholmgren" target="_blank">ùïè / Twitter</a
            >.
