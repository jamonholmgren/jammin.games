        <h3>Alpha 0.3 Released!</h3>
        <p>Posted September 19, 2025 by Jamon Holmgren</p>
        <p>
          After over 6 months in development, I've released Alpha 0.3 of Into
          the Dawn to my Discord testers!
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a tremendous amount of work -- over 20,000 lines of code
          changed, most systems substantially or entirely rewritten, and a good
          base for the next phase of development.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a video talking about 0.3 and beyond:</p>

            It's still a ways out, with a ton more work to be done. Now I can
            focus on adding a core gameplay loop, more features, and a proper
            campaign and pilot career.
          </p>
          <p>
            0.4 will focus on the core gameplay loop. I won't have a full
            dynamic campaign, but you can sign up as a pilot, do a training
            mission, and fly missions.

        <h3>Progress Report after 1 year of development</h3>
        <p>Posted August 10, 2025 by Jamon Holmgren</p>
        <p>
          I've been working on Into the Dawn for a bit over a year now in my
          free time, and making steady progress other than a few months last
          fall and a couple months this spring.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's coming together and I find myself playing it for hours at a time.
          I even end up having to force myself to stop playing and work on it,
          which is unusual -- usually I find things that annoy me and I go fix
          them. But instead I find myself just delighted with playing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: I added a section
          <a href="#about-the-game">About the Game</a> below, so check it out. I
          talk about my motivations for making Into the Dawn and what it's all
          about.
        </p>
        <p>There's a lot to go over, so I'll just list the highlights:</p>

        <div class="expandable-content">
          <h4>Major Systems Added</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Damage Modeling System:</strong> HUD flickers when
              damaged, engines lose power, tail damage causes a steady pull to
              the right, smoke and fire effects from damaged sections, and
              damage reports are now displayed on HUD
              <figure class="news-image">
                <img src="../assets/images/damage-0.3.jpg" alt="Damage Model" />

          <p>
            I appreciate you checking out my in-progress game, Into the Dawn!
            It's a combat helicopter game, reminiscent of the amazing combat
            helicopter sims of the 90s, but with multiplayer, cross-platform
            play, modern controls...
          </p>
          <div class="expandable-content">
            <p>
              Missions won't be quite like this video in the actual game, but
              this gives you a taste of what the core gameplay is like. In this
              case, I scattered some tanks and AA vehicles around the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              They're all set to "Green" (inexperienced) and "Relaxed" (meaning
              they aren't being vigilant), so they see me very late, and fire
              inaccurately when they do see me.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the actual game, you'll have to plan out routes much more
              carefully, fly low (under 150 feet), and approach cautiously if
              you want to live. If you fly high, someone will take your head
              off.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also don't have any weapons in the game other than the 30mm
              chaingun (which I also repurposed for the AA test vehicle) and a
              .50cal (for the tanks). The damage model works but needs to be
              refined.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's much, much more needing to be done here. For example --
              trees! But for the first time, I felt like I could go fly and
              complete a mission myself. This was a lot of fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Note: multiplayer WORKS ... I flew this one myself, but you can
              totally have human copilot/gunners and wingmen!)
