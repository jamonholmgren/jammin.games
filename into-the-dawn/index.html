        Into the Dawn is a combat helicopter game in development by Jammin
        Games. It will feature immersive helicopter combat, co-op multiplayer,
        dynamic campaigns, and much more!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container about-game-section" id="about-the-game">
      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <div class="about-game-content">
        <p>
          Into the Dawn is a combat helicopter game reminiscent of the great
          helicopter simulators of the 90s, but with modern co-op multiplayer,
          cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, Steam Deck) support, and all
          the love an indie game developer can put into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You start as a fresh US Army Aviation recruit, sometime in the early
          2000s, joining up as the west coast of the USA is being invaded by a
          strong and determined enemy, well-equipped with Soviet-era equipment.
          All across the Pacific coast, enemy soldiers, tanks, APCs, artillery,
          and more are pushing inland, and the call from US leadership has gone
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your skill, determination, and grit are needed to defend your country.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you progress, you'll experience flight training, weapons training,
          and (optionally) officer training. You'll then be sent into the fray
          with a variety of aircraft: Apaches, Blackhawk DAPs, Kiowa Warriors,
          Little Birds, SuperCobra/Vipers, Huey/Venoms, and potentially others.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the weapons side, you'll deploy 30mm chainguns, Hellfire missiles,
          HYDRA-70 rockets, Stinger anti-air missiles, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll face enemy T-72, T-80, and other main battle tanks, BMP
          infantry fighting vehicles, BTR armored personnel carriers, ZSU
          anti-air artillery and SAM anti-air missiles, infantry equipped with a
          variety of weapons, and others to be announced later.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll need a great team with you if you're going to succeed. If you
          take the officer route, you'll be the commander of a platoon of
          helicopters. As you progress you will be able to recruit a whole
          roster of AI pilots and CP/Gs. Scout for the top flight school
          graduates, recruit them to your platoon, assign them to pilot and CP/G
          seats to be your wingmen based on their aptitudes and capabilities.
          But be sure to take care of them; losing an experienced crew is the
          ultimate loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from your AI pilot roster, you'll also be able to fly with your
          human friends. Into the Dawn supports up to 8 players in multiplayer:
          4 pilots and 4 copilot/gunners, in a maximum 4 helicopter flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Missions are designed to take around 25 to 35 minutes – when lunchtime
          rolls around, grab your buddies and fly a quick mission. You'll be
          done with time to finish your sandwich and get back to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you complete missions, you'll be promoted through the ranks – both
          the Warrant Officer track as well as commissioned officer track.
          You'll also receive medals and awards for your heroic actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Into the Dawn is designed to work very well on mid-level computers,
          Windows, Macs, and Linux machines, as well as Steam Decks. You don't
          need a gamer rig to play it. In fact, even low end machines can
          participate – you can turn the graphics level way down to achieve a
          good enough framerate to play with your friends. Or, if you do happen
          to have a top notch gamer rig, then crank everything up and enjoy the
          views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, Into the Dawn is about a love of combat helicopters and a
          deep respect for the men and women who operate them in defense of
          freedom.

        <h3>Alpha 0.3 Released!</h3>
        <p>Posted September 19, 2025 by Jamon Holmgren</p>
        <p>
          After over 6 months in development, I've released Alpha 0.3 of Into
          the Dawn to my Discord testers!
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a tremendous amount of work -- over 20,000 lines of code
          changed, most systems substantially or entirely rewritten, and a good
          base for the next phase of development.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a video talking about 0.3 and beyond:</p>

          <p>
            It's still a ways out, with a ton more work to be done. Now I can
            focus on adding a core gameplay loop, more features, and a proper
            campaign and pilot career.
          </p>
          <p>
            0.4 will focus on the core gameplay loop. I won't have a full
            dynamic campaign, but you can sign up as a pilot, do a training
            mission, and fly missions.
          </p>

        <h3>Progress Report after 1 year of development</h3>
        <p>Posted August 10, 2025 by Jamon Holmgren</p>
        <p>
          I've been working on Into the Dawn for a bit over a year now in my
          free time, and making steady progress other than a few months last
          fall and a couple months this spring.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's coming together and I find myself playing it for hours at a time.
          I even end up having to force myself to stop playing and work on it,
          which is unusual -- usually I find things that annoy me and I go fix
          them. But instead I find myself just delighted with playing it.
        </p>

        <p>There's a lot to go over, so I'll just list the highlights:</p>

        <div class="expandable-content">
          <h4>Major Systems Added</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Damage Modeling System:</strong> HUD flickers when
              damaged, engines lose power, tail damage causes a steady pull to
              the right, smoke and fire effects from damaged sections, and
              damage reports are now displayed on HUD

          <p>
            I appreciate you checking out my in-progress game, Into the Dawn!
            It's a combat helicopter game, reminiscent of the amazing combat
            helicopter sims of the 90s, but with multiplayer, cross-platform
            play, modern controls...
          </p>
          <div class="expandable-content">
            <p>
              Missions won't be quite like this video in the actual game, but
              this gives you a taste of what the core gameplay is like. In this
              case, I scattered some tanks and AA vehicles around the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              They're all set to "Green" (inexperienced) and "Relaxed" (meaning
              they aren't being vigilant), so they see me very late, and fire
              inaccurately when they do see me.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the actual game, you'll have to plan out routes much more
              carefully, fly low (under 150 feet), and approach cautiously if
              you want to live. If you fly high, someone will take your head
              off.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also don't have any weapons in the game other than the 30mm
              chaingun (which I also repurposed for the AA test vehicle) and a
              .50cal (for the tanks). The damage model works but needs to be
              refined.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's much, much more needing to be done here. For example --
              trees! But for the first time, I felt like I could go fly and
              complete a mission myself. This was a lot of fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Note: multiplayer WORKS ... I flew this one myself, but you can
              totally have human copilot/gunners and wingmen!)
